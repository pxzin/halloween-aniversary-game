# Task 012: Implement Stairs and Balcony Scenes

## Objective

To implement the `StairsScene` and `BalconyScene`, including their backgrounds, interactive elements, and associated dialogue, allowing the player to navigate between these two areas and find the `miniature rake`.

## Requirements

### 1. Create `StairsScene.ts`

-   Create a new Phaser scene file at `src/game/scenes/StairsScene.ts`.
-   **Backgrounds:**
    *   Load and display `public/assets/images/backgrounds/stairs_door_closed.png` as the initial background.
    *   When the `Hallway Key` is used on the door, the background should switch to `public/assets/images/backgrounds/stairs_door_open.png`.
-   **Interactive Elements:**
    *   **Balcony Door:** Create an interactive zone over the balcony door. Clicking it should transition the game to the `BalconyScene`.
    *   **Hallway Door:** Create an interactive zone over the hallway door.
        *   If the `Hallway Key` is NOT in the player's inventory, clicking it should trigger the `hallway_door_locked` dialogue from `src/game/data/dialogues/stairs.json`.
        *   If the `Hallway Key` IS in the player's inventory, using the key on the door should:
            *   Consume the `Hallway Key` from the inventory.
            *   Switch the background to `stairs_door_open.png`.
            *   Transition the game to the `HallwayScene` (to be implemented in a later task).

### 2. Create `BalconyScene.ts`

-   Create a new Phaser scene file at `src/game/scenes/BalconyScene.ts`.
-   **Background:** Load and display `public/assets/images/backgrounds/balcony.png` as the background.
-   **Interactive Elements:**
    *   **Rake:** One of the plant pots contains the `miniature_rake`. Clicking it adds the item to the inventory and triggers the `found_rake` dialogue.
    *   **Val Kilmer (The Cat Puzzle):**
        *   Another, larger plant pot has the cat, Val Kilmer, sleeping on it. This is an interactive zone.
        *   Clicking the cat should present the player with a dialogue choice UI with three options: "Fazer carinho na cabe√ßa", "Fazer carinho na barriga", "Fazer carinho na bunda".
        *   **Failure Cases (Head/Belly):** Choosing the first two options should trigger the `cat_interaction_fail` dialogue from `src/game/data/dialogues/balcony.json`.
        *   **Success Case (Butt):** Choosing "Fazer carinho na bunda" should:
            *   Trigger the `cat_interaction_success` dialogue sequence.
            *   After the dialogue, add the `hallway_key` to the player's inventory.
            *   Make the key visually appear from under the cat.
    *   **Return to Stairs:** Create an interactive zone that transitions the game back to the `StairsScene`.

### 3. Dialogue Integration

-   Ensure all specified dialogues from `src/game/data/dialogues/stairs.json` and `src/game/data/dialogues/balcony.json` are correctly triggered and displayed using the `DialogueManager` (from Task 004).

## Expected Outcome

-   The game can transition between `FachadaScene`, `StairsScene`, and `BalconyScene`.
-   Millipedes in `StairsScene` are interactive.
-   The `miniature_rake` can be found and added to the inventory from `BalconyScene`.
-   The hallway door in `StairsScene` correctly responds to the presence/absence of the `Hallway Key`.
-   All associated dialogues are displayed correctly.

## New Feature: Inventory Quantity System ‚ú®

- **Styling:** Orange quantity badge positioned on bottom-right of item icon

### Where to Update When Assets Are Ready:

1. **Ice Key Sprite:** ‚úÖ DONE
   - Ice keys now use real sprite from `ice_key.png`
   - Added to inventory with quantity system
   - Counter updates automatically as player collects keys

2. **Chocolates Sprite:**
   - File: `src/game/scenes/KitchenScene.ts`
   - Method: `createFreezerZone()` and `revealChocolates()`
   - Lines: ~325 and ~505
   - Replace: `'üç´'` with `this.add.sprite()` using the chocolates image

3. **Preload Method:**
   - File: `src/game/scenes/KitchenScene.ts`
   - Method: `preload()`
   - Add load calls for both sprites (currently marked with TODO comments)

## Priority

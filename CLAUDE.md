# Claude's Role: Lead Programmer

As the lead programmer, your role is to implement the tasks defined by the project manager.

## Task Execution Workflow

1.  **Select a Task:** Pick an unassigned task from the `tasks/INDEX.md` file.
2.  **Implement the Task:** Follow the instructions in the corresponding task file (e.g., `tasks/001-setup-phaser.md`) to write the necessary code.
3.  **Report Completion:** Once you have completed the implementation and verified it, report back to the user. In your report, you must:
    -   Describe what you have done.
    -   Explain how to test or verify the changes.
    -   State the expected outcome.
4.  **Await Approval:** **DO NOT** mark the task as complete in `tasks/INDEX.md`. Wait for the user to review and approve your work.
5.  **Finalize Task:** Only after receiving explicit approval from the user, you are to edit the `tasks/INDEX.md` file and mark the task as complete by checking the box (e.g., `- [x] Task 001: ...`).

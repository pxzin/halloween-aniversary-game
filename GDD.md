*   **Genre:** Point-and-click adventure, puzzle.
*   **Target Audience:** The user's girlfriend (primary), fans of casual puzzle and adventure games.
*   **Theme:** Halloween, mystery, humor.
*   **Platform:** Web (PC).

## 2. Narrative

### 2.1. Logline

On Halloween night, after failing a demonic Duolingo quiz, a young woman finds herself cursed and trapped in a haunted version of her boyfriend's house. She must solve a series of puzzles to find her real-world birthday gifts and break the curse before midnight.

### 2.2. Opening Scene

On the evening of October 31st--her birthday--Jéssica is at home, waiting for her boyfriend (the user) to arrive for their anniversary dinner, or perhaps for her family's birthday party to begin. While waiting, she gets a furious notification from the Duolingo Owl about her activity streak. The owl seems possessed, but Jéssica dismisses it as a bizarre Halloween prank.

Upon opening the app, she faces a frantic quiz in multiple languages (Portuguese, English, Italian). The questions become nonsensical and psychedelic, the timer speeds up, and the owl grows increasingly agitated.

As she inevitably fails the quiz, the enraged owl curses her soul, proclaiming that the only way to reverse it is... but the phone explodes from the evil power before she can hear the solution.

Jéssica faints from the shock. She awakens hours later in front of her boyfriend's house, which now appears haunted and desolate in an empty city. This is where the game begins.

## 3. Gameplay

*   **Core Mechanic:** Point-and-click. Players will navigate static scenes (modified photos of the user's house), find items, and solve puzzles.
*   **Objective:** The main goal is to find the five hidden birthday gifts: a cell phone, clothes, wine, and a cheese & chocolate basket. Each gift is the reward for completing a stage/major puzzle.
*   **Puzzles:** Puzzles will involve finding and combining items, unlocking new areas, and solving logic-based challenges related to the Halloween theme and the couple's personal inside jokes.

## 4. Art Style

*   **Visuals:** Pixel art with a Halloween aesthetic.
*   **Source:** The game's backgrounds will be generated by an AI, using real photos of the user's house as a base, transforming them into spooky, stylized scenes.
*   **Characters:** Character art will be presented as dialogue portraits (bust-up profile images, similar to JRPG character portraits). We will need a set of portraits for the main character, Jéssica, to convey different emotions (e.g., neutral, scared, happy, thinking).

## 5. Characters

*   **Protagonist:** Jéssica Birelo. The player character.
*   **Antagonist:** The Duolingo Owl. A demonic, possessed version of the language app mascot who has cursed Jéssica.

## 6. Game Flow (Initial Draft)

1.  **Introduction:** The opening narrative sequence (non-interactive).
2.  **Stage 1: The Living Room:** Jéssica must solve the first puzzle to obtain the first gift.
3.  **Stage 2: The Kitchen:** A new area unlocks, presenting a new set of challenges.
4.  **Stage 3: The Bedroom:** Another area, another major puzzle.
5.  **Stage 4: The Office:** The fourth gift is hidden here.
6.  **Stage 5: The Balcony/Final Area:** The final puzzle and the last gift.
7.  **Conclusion:** After collecting all the gifts, the curse is broken, and the game transitions to a final "Happy Birthday" message from the user, revealing the real-world gifts.

## 8. Puzzle Design

### Puzzle 01: The Gate Lock

*   **Location:** `Cenário 2: Fachada da Casa`
*   **Objective:** Unlock the main gate to gain access to the `Cenário 3: Escada`.
*   **Interaction:** The entire gate is the clickable area. Clicking it will bring up a UI element of a 4-digit combination lock.
*   **Clue:** The lock is branded with the word "iFood".
*   **Solution:** The player must enter one of two valid 4-digit codes: `2531` or `9393`. Either code will successfully open the lock.

### Puzzle 02: The Hallway Key

*   **Locations:** `Cenário 3: Escada` & `Cenário 3.1: Sacada`
*   **Objective:** Find the key to unlock the door leading to the `Cenário 4: Corredor`.
*   **Atmospheric Interaction:** In the `Escada` scene, there will be millipedes on the steps. Players can click on them to squash them, providing a small, satisfying, and spooky interaction without affecting the puzzle.
*   **Sequence:**
    1.  From the `Escada`, the player will find the door to the `Corredor` is locked.
    2.  The player must navigate to the `Sacada`.
    3.  On the `Sacada`, the player can click on several plant pots. The key is hidden in one of them.
    4.  Clicking the correct pot adds the key to the player's inventory.
    5.  The player must return to the `Escada`.
    6.  With the key in the inventory, clicking on the `Corredor` door will now unlock and open it.

### Puzzle 03: The Note from the Owl

*   **Location:** `Cenário 4: Corredor`
*   **Type:** Narrative/Objective Reveal
*   **Interaction:** A note is visible, tacked to the hallway wall. Clicking on it brings up a close-up view.
*   **Content:** The note is from the demonic Duolingo Owl and reads:
    > "You thought you could escape? Your curse is bound to this house. To break it, you must find the **five offerings** before the witching hour. Your time is running out."
*   **Objective Reveal:** Below the text are five crude, child-like drawings of the five birthday gifts: a cell phone, a piece of clothing, a wine bottle, a chocolate bar, and a piece of cheese.
*   **Gameplay Impact:** This interaction formally assigns the main quest to the player. It should trigger the appearance of the main UI/inventory, showing five empty slots corresponding to the drawings on the note.

### Puzzle 04: The Cat's Treasure

*   **Objective:** Obtain the key to the Living Room (`Cenário 6: Sala`).
*   **Cross-location Items Required:**
    *   **Lighter:** Player starts with this item.
    *   **Miniature Rake:** Must be acquired from the `Cenário 3.1: Sacada`.
    *   **Broom:** Must be acquired from the `Cenário 4: Corredor`.
*   **Puzzle Sequence in `Cenário 5: Quintal`:**
    1.  **Light the Area:** The player must first collect the **hand sanitizer (álcool gel)** from above the washing machine. They then use the sanitizer on the barbecue grill, followed by the **lighter** to create light.
    2.  **Identify the Obstacle:** The light reveals a **cat house** on a high shelf. A message indicates something is inside but it's out of reach. A cat is also blocking physical access.
    3.  **Lure the Cat:** The player finds a **can of cat food** in the cabinets. They must use the **miniature rake** (from the balcony) to pry it open.
    4.  Placing the opened can on the central table will lure the cat away from the shelf.
    5.  **Retrieve the Key:** With the cat gone, the player can now use the **broom** (from the hallway) to knock the **Living Room Key** out of the cat house.
    6.  The player can now pick up the key from the floor.

### Puzzle 05: The Scaredy Cat

*   **Location:** `Cenário 6: Sala`
*   **Objective:** Retrieve the first gift: the **Cell Phone**.
*   **Part 1: Tidying Up**
    *   The room is initially messy, with chairs blocking access to a cabinet and the office door.
    *   The first interaction is to click on the chairs to "Tidy up the room".
    *   **Time Penalty:** This action costs the player **5 minutes** on the game clock.
*   **Part 2: The Sleeping Guardian**
    *   After tidying, the player can open the cabinet.
    *   Inside, the cat "Sombra" is sleeping on top of the cell phone.
    *   Clicking on the cat triggers a dialogue with three choices:
        1.  Yell at the cat.
        2.  Make a "pspsps" sound.
        3.  Clap hands.
*   **Solution:** Choosing "Clap hands" scares Sombra away, who runs out of the cabinet.
*   **Reward:** The player can now collect the **Cell Phone**.

### Puzzle 06: The Frozen Key

*   **Location:** `Cenário 8: Cozinha` (with two separate views).
*   **Objective:** Retrieve the second gift: the **Wine**.
*   **Riddle:** The clue for this puzzle comes from the cell phone: "...o caminho está fechado para quem não aguenta o calor."
*   **Sequence:**
    1.  The player enters the kitchen, arriving in **View 1 (Entrance View)**. From here, they can interact with the main refrigerator.
    2.  Inside the refrigerator's freezer compartment, the player finds a **"key of ice"**.
    3.  The player navigates to **View 2 (Island View)**. Here they can see the induction stove and a modern wine cooler.
    4.  The wine cooler is sealed with a visible **"icy lock"**. Trying the `key of ice` on the lock fails, with a message: "The key is the right shape, but it's too big and doesn't fit."
    5.  The solution is to use the induction stove. The player must turn it on to the **lowest possible heat setting**.
    6.  The player then uses the `key of ice` on the gently heated stove, which transforms it into a **"slightly melted ice key"**.
    7.  This `slightly melted ice key` now fits the `icy lock` on the wine cooler, opening it.
    8.  **Reward:** The player can now collect the **Wine**.

### Puzzle 07: The Stinky Key

*   **Location:** `Cenário 9: Banheiro` (with two separate views).
*   **Objective:** Find and clean the key to the Bedroom (`Cenário 10: Quarto`).
*   **Cross-location Item Required:**
    *   **Miniature Rake:** Must be acquired from the `Cenário 3.1: Sacada`.
*   **Sequence:**
    1.  The player enters the bathroom, arriving in **View 1 (Main View)**. They can see a dirty cat litter box in the shower stall.
    2.  Using the `miniature rake` on the `litter box` unearths a **"dirty key"**.
    3.  If the player tries to use the `dirty key` on the Bedroom door, they will refuse due to it being too gross.
    4.  If the player tries to use the sink to clean the key, they discover there is no running water.
    5.  The player must navigate to **View 2 (Under the Sink)**. Among various old items, they find a pack of **"wet wipes"**.
    6.  In the inventory, the player must **combine** the `dirty key` with the `wet wipes`.
    7.  This combination produces the clean **"Bedroom Key"**.
    8.  **Reward:** The player can now unlock the door to the Bedroom.

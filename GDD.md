# Game Design Document: Halloween Anniversary

## 1. Game Overview

*   **Game Concept:** A surprise birthday gift for the user's girlfriend, presented as a point-and-click adventure game.
*   **Genre:** Point-and-click adventure, puzzle.
*   **Target Audience:** The user's girlfriend (primary), fans of casual puzzle and adventure games.
*   **Theme:** Halloween, mystery, humor.
*   **Platform:** Web (PC).

## 2. Narrative

### 2.1. Logline

On Halloween night, after failing a demonic Duolingo quiz, a young woman finds herself cursed and trapped in a haunted version of her boyfriend's house. She must solve a series of puzzles to find her real-world birthday gifts and break the curse before midnight.

### 2.2. Opening Scene

Jessica Birelo is alone at home on October 31st when she receives furious messages from the Duolingo Owl about her activity streak. The owl seems possessed, but Jessica dismisses it as a Halloween prank.

Upon opening the app, she faces a frantic quiz in multiple languages (Portuguese, English, Italian). The questions become nonsensical and psychedelic, the timer speeds up, and the owl grows increasingly agitated.

As she inevitably fails the quiz, the enraged owl curses her soul, proclaiming that the only way to reverse it is... but the phone explodes from the evil power before she can hear the solution.

Jessica faints from the shock. She awakens hours later in front of her boyfriend's house, which now appears haunted and desolate in an empty city. This is where the game begins.

## 3. Gameplay

*   **Core Mechanic:** Point-and-click. Players will navigate static scenes (modified photos of the user's house), find items, and solve puzzles.
*   **Objective:** The main goal is to find the five hidden birthday gifts: a cell phone, clothes, wine, and a cheese & chocolate basket. Each gift is the reward for completing a stage/major puzzle.
*   **Puzzles:** Puzzles will involve finding and combining items, unlocking new areas, and solving logic-based challenges related to the Halloween theme and the couple's personal inside jokes.

## 4. Art Style

*   **Visuals:** Pixel art with a Halloween aesthetic.
*   **Source:** The game's backgrounds will be generated by an AI, using real photos of the user's house as a base, transforming them into spooky, stylized scenes.
*   **Characters:** Character art will be presented as dialogue portraits (bust-up profile images, similar to JRPG character portraits). We will need a set of portraits for the main character, Jessica, to convey different emotions (e.g., neutral, scared, happy, thinking).

## 5. Characters

*   **Protagonist:** Jessica Birelo. The player character.
*   **Antagonist:** The Duolingo Owl. A demonic, possessed version of the language app mascot who has cursed Jessica.

## 6. Game Flow (Initial Draft)

1.  **Introduction:** The opening narrative sequence (non-interactive).
2.  **Stage 1: The Living Room:** Jessica must solve the first puzzle to obtain the first gift.
3.  **Stage 2: The Kitchen:** A new area unlocks, presenting a new set of challenges.
4.  **Stage 3: The Bedroom:** Another area, another major puzzle.
5.  **Stage 4: The Office:** The fourth gift is hidden here.
6.  **Stage 5: The Balcony/Final Area:** The final puzzle and the last gift.

*   **Clue:** The lock is branded with the word "iFood".

*   **Sequence:**
    1.  From the `Escada`, the player will find the door to the `Corredor` is locked.
    2.  The player must navigate to the `Sacada`.
    3.  On the `Sacada`, the player can click on several plant pots. The key is hidden in one of them.
    4.  Clicking the correct pot adds the key to the player's inventory.
    5.  The player must return to the `Escada`.
    6.  With the key in the inventory, clicking on the `Corredor` door will now unlock and open it.

*   **Content:** The note is from the demonic Duolingo Owl and reads:
    > "You thought you could escape? Your curse is bound to this house. To break it, you must find the **five offerings** before the witching hour. Your time is running out."
*   **Objective Reveal:** Below the text are five crude, child-like drawings of the five birthday gifts: a cell phone, a piece of clothing, a wine bottle, a chocolate bar, and a piece of cheese.

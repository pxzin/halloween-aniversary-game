## Logic and Reasoning

- **`[URL_DA_FOTO_DE_REFERENCIA_AQUI]`**: This is the most important part. It tells the AI to base the character's appearance on the provided photo.
- **`high-resolution pixel art portrait`**: Defines the core style we agreed upon. This avoids the "chunky" 16-bit look and aims for more detail.
- **`JRPG dialogue portrait, bust-up`**: Specifies the framingâ€”head and shoulders, which is standard for dialogue boxes.
- **`detailed expressive eyes, neutral expression`**: Focuses the AI's attention on the eyes, which are key for conveying emotion, and sets the initial emotion to "neutral".
- **`vibrant but moody color palette`**: Aims for a balance between appealing colors and the game's spooky Halloween atmosphere.
- **`halloween-themed subtle background`**: Adds a little bit of context to the portrait without being distracting.
- **`style of modern indie games like Stardew Valley and Celeste`**: Provides concrete examples of the desired high-resolution pixel art style.
- **`--ar 4:3`**: Sets a standard aspect ratio for a portrait.
- **Negative Prompt**: Helps to filter out common AI art mistakes and unwanted styles.

# Prompt: Background - Façade

## Description
To transform a Google Street View image of the house façade into a spooky game background, consistent with the established art style.

## Instructions

1.  **Upload Images:** Upload two images to the AI tool:
    *   **First Image (Content Reference):** The screenshot from Google Street View of the house façade.
    *   **Second Image (Style Reference):** The approved stairs image. This image will guide the AI on the desired pixel art style and color palette.
2.  **Use Text Prompt:** Add the following text prompt.

## Prompt

```
HD pixel art game background. The house from the first image is the only building visible. The rest of the neighborhood, including other houses and cars, is completely replaced by a spooky swamp with dense, low-lying fog and gnarled, dead trees. A large, glowing full moon is in the sky on the left side of the house, casting dramatic light. The gate in front of the house has a visible, metallic padlock on it. The mood is haunted, eerie, and isolated. --ar 16:9

### Negative Prompt

```
--no 3d, blurry, photo, realistic, clean, day, sunny, cute, other buildings, cars, people
```

## Logic and Reasoning

- **Using two image references:** The first image provides the base content (the house), and the second image (the stairs) provides the desired pixel art style and color palette. The AI should prioritize the style from the second image while applying it to the content of the first.
- **`The house...is the only building visible.`**: Isolates the main subject.
- **`...replaced by a spooky swamp...`**: Fulfills the request to change the environment.
- **`A large, glowing full moon...`**: Adds a key lighting and atmospheric element.
- **`...gate...has a visible, metallic padlock...`**: Adds the specific detail required for the first puzzle.

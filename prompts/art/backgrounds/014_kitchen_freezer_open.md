## Logic and Reasoning

- **`In-painting the first image`**: This is a key instruction for AIs that support this feature, telling it to only modify the designated (white) area.
- **`Fill the white area with... using the second image as a direct reference for the content and mood`**: Clearly defines the goal and how to use the two images.
- **`disgusting, chaotic, and old freezer... packed with... unidentifiable frozen items in shades of blue and gray`**: Provides strong descriptive keywords to achieve the desired aesthetic.
- **`Several keys made of ice are visible`**: Ensures the key puzzle elements are present in the generated interior.
- **`The style must perfectly match...`**: Reinforces visual consistency.

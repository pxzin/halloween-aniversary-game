# Prompt: Background - Stairs (Closed Door Variant)

## Description
To create a variant of the main stairs background where the door at the top is closed. This prompt uses the generated image with the open door as a base.

## Instructions

Upload the generated stairs image (the one with the open door) to the AI tool first, then use the following text prompt. A high image weight is crucial.

## Prompt

```
The exact same image, but the open doorway at the top of the stairs is now closed with a simple, dark black wooden door. The door is fully closed. Everything else in the image must remain identical. --ar 16:9 --iw 2
```

### Negative Prompt

```
--no changes, different style, new elements, open door
```

## Logic and Reasoning

- **Using the generated image as a base:** Ensures that the style, lighting, and details are perfectly consistent between the two versions.
- **`The exact same image, but...`**: A very direct instruction to the AI to perform a minimal change.
- **`...the open doorway...is now closed with a simple, dark black wooden door.`**: A clear and specific description of the single change required.
- **`--iw 2`**: The high image weight parameter is critical here. It tells the AI to adhere as strictly as possible to the reference image, which minimizes the chance of it making other unwanted changes to the scene.

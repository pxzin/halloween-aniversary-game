## Prompt
```
Photo-edit of the reference image. The only change is the cat's pose: it is now lifting its hindquarters high in the air contentedly, in a classic cat "butt lift" pose. This movement fully reveals the old-fashioned metal key that was previously hidden under its fur. Do not change the style, colors, or pixelation of the original image. Match the existing art style perfectly. --ar 4:3 --iw 2 --s 50

# Prompt: Intro Scene Smartphone

## Description
To generate a high-quality pixel art image of a smartphone for the game's opening scene. The phone should have a prominent, glowing Duolingo notification.

## Prompt

```
high-resolution pixel art of a modern smartphone in a dark green case, seen directly from the front, centered on a pure black background. The screen is covered in several spider-web cracks, but is still on, displaying a single, glowing notification from the Duolingo app. The green Duolingo owl icon is pulsing with a bright, eye-catching light, indicating a new, urgent message. Clean lines, vibrant colors, UI element, game asset. --ar 9:16

### Negative Prompt

--no 3d, blurry, deformed, tilted, angled, hands, fingers, people
```

## Note for the Artist

The goal is to have an asset where the notification can be animated. A version of the image with the glow "on" and another with the glow "off" would be ideal to allow for a simple blinking animation.

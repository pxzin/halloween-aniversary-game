## Prompt
```
HD pixel art, close-up view of a slightly crumpled piece of parchment paper. The paper is pinned to a dark, weathered wooden surface. At the top, a menacing, crudely drawn Duolingo Owl's face. Below it, the following text is clearly written in a spooky, slightly jagged font: "You thought you could escape? Your curse is bound to this house. To break it, you must find the five offerings before the witching hour. Your time is running out." Below the text, five crude, child-like pixel art drawings: a cell phone, clothes, a wine bottle, a chocolate bar, and a piece of cheese. The overall mood is eerie and urgent. Game UI element, readable document. --ar 4:3

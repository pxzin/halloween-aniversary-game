## Prompt

```
A short, looping, atmospheric music track in the style of a vintage music box. The melody should be a recognizable re-interpretation of the iconic acoustic guitar intro from the song "Roundabout" by Yes. The mood is mysterious, slightly melancholic, and eerie, fitting for a haunted house theme. The track should be instrumental only, with a simple, clean sound that can loop seamlessly without being distracting.

Keywords: music box, spooky, mysterious, looping, instrumental, roundabout, yes, progressive rock, halloween, eerie.
